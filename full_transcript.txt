OK then my friends, so the first thing we need to do is create a new Nuxt application and the easiest way to do that is by using the Nuxt CLI. Now before you do this, remember to make sure you've been through the recommended setup which I talked about in the last lesson and then if we scroll down a bit we can see that it tells us to use the command right here npx nuxty init nuxtapp where nuxtapp is the name of your application so you can change this to something else if you want and then we use the code command to open VS Code in that new directory that Nuxt creates for us. Once we've got that open in VS Code we just then need to install all the dependencies using npm install so let's do all of this now on our computer. Alright then so open up your terminal and navigate to whatever directory you want to create this project in and then type npx nuxty init and then the name of your project I'm going to call it nuxt-dojo but call it whatever you want and then press enter. This is going to go ahead and create a brand new Nuxt project for us it might just take a minute or so. Alright so once that's done we need to cd into that directory so I'll say cd nuxt-dojo like so and then I'm going to open this up in VS Code by typing code and then a full stop to open this in the current directory. So press enter and this my friends is our new Nuxt application. Alright then so what I'm going to do is now just install all of the dependencies so let me open up a terminal and down here I'm going to type npm install like so. So now we've created the Nuxt project and we've installed all the project dependencies let me walk you through what all of these files are in the project. First we have this Nuxt config file right here which is a TypeScript file and Nuxt does recommend this file remaining as a TypeScript file but the rest of your application code doesn't have to be TypeScript it can be JavaScript if you so wish. and this config file right here is for you to extend or change the default nuxt configuration for your project you could add custom metadata here or register modules here you could also add environment variables like api keys in this file for use in other places in your application we'll be adding to this file later on in the course so that you will see it in action next up we've got the view file the app.view file right here this is the default root component of the application we'll be deleting this later but for now if we were to preview the site this would act as the home page content now you can see right now we have a small amount of content inside this component and actually nuxt is using this built-in content component to output some content onto the page this is a completely baked in component which includes a lot of content inside it that we can't actually see here and nuxt has probably done it this way so that the whole app component isn't full of messy content that we're probably just going to delete anyway so we'll see what content this pumps out when we preview the app in a browser shortly the nuxt folder is used by nuxt during development to generate the nuxt application and you don't need to go exploring inside this folder or change anything inside it and finally we just have our gitignore file for version control and our package files so that's a quick tour of the application next up we want to run the app so we can preview it in a browser to do that open up a terminal in the root directory of the project and type npm run dev and then press enter this is going to spin up a local dev server and show us a link in the terminal which we can then use to preview the site okay then so this is what it looks like currently in a browser so this is all content driven from that nuxt welcome component inside the app.vue component right there we are going to replace all of this later on but at least now we know this is working and we can preview this in a browser awesome so what i'm going to do now is just go and make a quick change to the app.vue component i'm going to delete all of this right here and just replace it with a P tag that says Hello ninjas or something like that and press save and when we save this it's going to auto update in the browser And we can see that right here. Awesome. So that's the Nuxt app up and running. We've created the app We've installed all the dependencies. We've spun up a local dev server and we can preview it now in the browser So in the next lesson, I'm going to show you how we can make multiple pages using few components
